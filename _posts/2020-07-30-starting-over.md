This is going to be a long-ish post. I'm just putting this down here to start it up.

I don't really remember how I wanted to start this post, but I wanted to start writing again and just thought that this space might be a good place to start. Of course, this is not the first time that I wanted to write again. Basically, I don't know how long this will last, but I gotta start somewhere.

So, what is this all about?

Well, after quite a bit of time making my way back here, I am finally learning code again.
