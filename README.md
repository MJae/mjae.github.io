Cloned this repo to restart my GitHub home page. I am also intending on setting up Jekyll to blog with it. Actually, this already had Jekyll, but it's been ages since I set it up and never returned to it. According to the GitHub page for the repo, it was 4 years go. I'm sure Jekyll would have had an update or two since then. So, I just deleted the folder to prepare the repo re-initiating Jekyll.
